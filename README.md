## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned the following:
- How to create a well-structured HTML document
- Benefits of the "Mobile First" approach to styling an HTML document
- How to use the Flexbox CSS component to create responsive design 

### Where I need help

Here is what I am currently struggling with:
- How to get rid of the blue link underneath the "Add to Cart" button text. 
- How to add an active state to the "Add to Cart" button

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This great resource helped me learn what Flexbox is and how to use it for my layout. For example, it helped me to center my product card horizontally and vertically in the middle of the viewport for all devices.  
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - The W3Schools helped me to get more familiar with various HTML tags and CSS selectors. 
- [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - This tool helped me to check the validity of my HTML document.
