### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This great resource helped me learn what Flexbox is and how to use it for my layout. For example, it helped me to center my product card horizontally and vertically in the middle of the viewport for all devices.  
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - The W3Schools helped me to get more familiar with various HTML tags and CSS selectors. 
- [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - This tool helped me to check the validity of my HTML document.
